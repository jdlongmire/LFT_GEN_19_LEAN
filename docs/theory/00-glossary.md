# 00 – Glossary (Symbols and Policy)

- 𝒮: universe of well-formed information states (e.g., finite directed logical graphs with negation)
- ℒ: logic-enforcement operator (applies 3FLL)
- 𝒜: admissible configurations; fixed points of ℒ

Core identity (boxed in the paper):
$$
\boxed{\mathcal{A} = \mathbb{L}(\mathcal{S})}
$$

Operator laws (on subsets of 𝒮): monotone, idempotent, contractive.
