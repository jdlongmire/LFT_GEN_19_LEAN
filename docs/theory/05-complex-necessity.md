# 05 – Complex Necessity (Conceptual Summary)

Orientation and continuity of inference cycles (C1–C2) require a faithful \(S^1\) action.
- Over \(\mathbb{R}\): only 2D rotation blocks, no eigencharacters.
- Over \(\mathbb{H}\): violates order-independence for independent systems (A7).
- Minimal consistent field: \(\mathbb{C}\).
