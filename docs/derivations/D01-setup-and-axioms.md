# D01 – Setup and Axioms

**3FLL:** Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle.

**Representation/Composition axioms:** A1–A7, C1–C2 (stated succinctly)
- A1 (Separability): \(\tilde{\Omega}\) countable.
- A2 (Distinguishability): \(\langle [G]|[H]\rangle = \delta_{GH}\).
- A3 (Symmetries): admissibility-preserving automorphisms act continuously, preserving overlaps up to phase.
- A4 (Coherence-invariant time): strongly continuous \(T_t\) with overlap preservation.
- A5 (Projection valuation): normalized, additive on orthogonal families, noncontextual, unitary-invariant.
- A7 (Order-independent composition): scalars commute across independent subsystems.
- C1 (Orientation sensitivity): clockwise vs counterclockwise cycles distinct.
- C2 (Connected change): continuous deformations act via strongly continuous subgroups.
