# D02 – Complex Necessity: \(\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{C}\)

**Assumptions used:** A1, A2, A3, A7, C1, C2.

## 1) S^1 action on oriented cycles
By C1–C2, there is a strongly continuous subgroup \(\{R_\theta\}\) acting nontrivially on the span of cycle classes,
preserving overlaps (A3).

## 2) Real exclusion
Any continuous orthogonal representation of \(S^1\) on a real inner-product space decomposes into 2D rotation blocks.
These have no nontrivial real eigenvectors, so orientation cannot be an eigencharacter over \(\mathbb{R}\).

## 3) Quaternionic exclusion (A7)
Nonreal quaternions fail to commute with all \(X\otimes I\) and \(I\otimes Y\), violating order-independence.
Hence \(\mathbb{H}\) is excluded.

**Conclusion:** The minimal consistent scalar field is \(\mathbb{C}\).
