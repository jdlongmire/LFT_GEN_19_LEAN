**3FLL (Three Fundamental Laws of Logic)**  
Identity: $A = A$.  
Non-Contradiction: $\neg(A \land \neg A)$.  
Excluded Middle: $A \lor \neg A$.

**$\Omega$**  
Observable physical reality; the set of logically admissible, physically realized states.

**$\mathcal{L}$**  
Logical operator enforcing 3FLL on the information field $S$.

**$S$ (Information States)**  
Configurations of epistemic knowledge; possible descriptions of the world before logical filtering.

**Logical Strain $D$**  
Functional quantifying logical tension in incomplete information systems:  
$$ D(G) = w_I v_I + w_N v_N + w_E v_E. $$

**$v_I$** – Internal contradiction strain.  
**$v_N$** – Non-classicality (entropic) strain.  
**$v_E$** – External misfit strain.

**Principle of Least Logical Strain**  
Hypothesized dynamical principle: physical laws emerge by minimizing $D$ over admissible evolutions.
