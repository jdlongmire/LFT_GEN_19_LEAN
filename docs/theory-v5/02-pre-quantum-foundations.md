# Pre-Quantum Foundations

This section establishes the logical infrastructure from which quantum structure will emerge. No quantum postulates are assumed—only the application of logical constraints to information structures.

## The Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL)

The 3FLL serve as prescriptive constraints, not merely descriptive tools:

1. **Identity:** $A = A$  
   A proposition maintains consistent meaning throughout any valid inference chain.

2. **Non-Contradiction:** $\neg(A \land \neg A)$  
   No configuration can simultaneously assert and deny the same proposition.

3. **Excluded Middle:** $A \lor \neg A$  
   Every well-formed proposition must resolve to either true or false in any complete description.

These laws are treated as *active filters* that determine which information patterns can exist physically, not passive observations about existing patterns.

## Information Field and Admissibility

### The Syntactic Space $\mathcal{S}$

$\mathcal{S}$ represents the space of all formally describable configurations—every pattern that can be syntactically specified, regardless of logical consistency. This includes:
- Self-contradictory descriptions  
- Incomplete specifications
- Overdetermined systems
- Logically coherent configurations

$\mathcal{S}$ is deliberately permissive: if it can be written down formally, it belongs to $\mathcal{S}$.

### The Logic-Enforcement Operator $\mathbb{L}$

The operator $\mathbb{L}: \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S}) \to \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S})$ applies the 3FLL as a filter, with three key properties:

1. **Monotone:** $X \subseteq Y \Rightarrow \mathbb{L}(X) \subseteq \mathbb{L}(Y)$  
2. **Idempotent:** $\mathbb{L}(\mathbb{L}(X)) = \mathbb{L}(X)$  
3. **Contractive:** $\mathbb{L}(X) \subseteq X$

These ensure $\mathbb{L}$ acts as a proper logical filter: it preserves subset relations, applying it twice changes nothing, and it only removes—never adds—elements.

### The Admissible Set

The central identity of LFT:

$$\boxed{\mathcal{A} = \mathbb{L}(\mathcal{S})}$$

$\mathcal{A}$ contains precisely those configurations that survive logical filtering. Crucially:
- Membership in $\mathcal{A}$ is binary—a configuration either satisfies the 3FLL or it doesn't  
- No probabilistic or energetic considerations enter at this level  
- $\mathcal{A}$ represents logical possibility, not physical probability  

## Graph-Theoretic Realization

### Admissible Logical Graphs

To make $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathbb{L}$ concrete, we represent configurations as directed graphs:

$$G = (V, E, \tau)$$

where:  
- $V$: vertices representing atomic propositions  
- $E \subseteq V \times V$: directed edges representing logical implications  
- $\tau: V \to V$: **negation involution** satisfying $\tau(\tau(v)) = v$ for all $v \in V$

### Admissibility Conditions

A graph $G \in \mathcal{S}$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$ iff:

1. **Identity:** Every vertex has a self-loop: $(v,v) \in E$ for all $v \in V$  
2. **Non-Contradiction:** No directed path exists from any $v$ to $\tau(v)$  
3. **Excluded Middle:** In any consistent subgraph, exactly one of $\{v, \tau(v)\}$ appears for each proposition symbol  

These conditions are algorithmically checkable, making admissibility determination explicit.

### Logical Equivalence Classes

Two graphs $G, H \in \mathcal{A}$ are *logically equivalent* ($G \sim H$) if they yield identical truth valuations under all consistent assignments.  
Equivalently, they have isomorphic quotient truth tables.  
We work with equivalence classes $[G]$ rather than individual graphs, as logically equivalent structures should have identical physical implications.

The quotient space $\mathcal{A} / \!\sim$ forms the basis for our state space construction.

## Why This Matters

Before introducing any quantum machinery, we've established:
1. A clear criterion for what can exist (admissibility)  
2. A concrete representation (graphs)  
3. An equivalence relation (logical equivalence)  

This foundation is purely logical—no physics has been smuggled in. The quantum structure will emerge when we ask: **"How must admissible configurations compose and transform while preserving logical coherence?"**

## Open Questions at This Stage

Several questions arise that the next sections must address:
- How do continuous transformations act on discrete graph structures?  
- What mathematical structure preserves logical equivalence under composition?  
- Why should logical configurations form a vector space at all?  

These questions drive us toward the vector space structure explored in Section 4.
