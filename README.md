## Overview

Logic Field Theory (LFT) is a research framework that derives the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics from the **Three Fundamental Laws of Logic** (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle) without presupposing physical postulates. This project (**GEN\_19**) refines the theoretical foundation, develops formal derivations, and prepares the framework for publication and formal verification.

## Entry Points

* **Theory Narrative:** `docs/theory-v5/`
* **Formal Derivations:** `docs/derivations-v5/`
* **Historical Papers:** `docs/position-papers/`
* **Session Notes:** `docs/sessions/`
* **Planning Docs:** `planning/`

## Current Status

* Theory narrative structure complete.
* Derivation stubs ready for content migration.
* Historical PDFs archived for reference.
* Repo structure finalized and flattened for clean navigation.

## Next Steps

1. Populate `theory-v5/` with merged prose from position paper and session notes.
2. Transfer full derivations into `derivations-v5/`.
3. Add diagrams and flowcharts to `figures/`.
4. Begin Lean 4 mapping in `lean-map/` after theory lock.
