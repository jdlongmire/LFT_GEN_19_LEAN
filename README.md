# Logic Field Theory v5

This repository hosts the **v5** synthesis of Logic Field Theory (LFT).

- `/docs/theory-v5`: prose narrative (read first)
- `/docs/derivations-v5`: full, math-first derivations
- `/lean-map`: crosswalk to the Lean formalization

Symbol policy: use **𝒜 = ℒ(𝒮)** for the core identity. Avoid Ω.
