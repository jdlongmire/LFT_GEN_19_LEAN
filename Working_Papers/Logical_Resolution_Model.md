## Abstract

The *Logical Resolution Model* (LRM) reframes quantum measurement by treating the **Three Fundamental Laws of Logic** (3FLL) as ontic constraints on the admissible states of physical systems. In LRM, a quantum system's possible states are fixed at preparation — typically via manipulation of a quantum field with emitters — and bounded by intrinsic physical constraints that exclude logically inconsistent configurations. The quantum state is interpreted as a **resolution-dependent description** of a fixed ontic reality, not the reality itself. What standard quantum mechanics calls *wavefunction collapse* is replaced by a continuous **resolution process**, which progressively eliminates inadmissible possibilities until the description matches the system's actual state. A field-theoretic Lagrangian formulation is provided to demonstrate how resolution can emerge from physical interactions. The model is empirically equivalent to standard quantum mechanics but offers greater parsimony, an observer-independent ontology, and a principled integration of logic into physics.

## 1. Introduction

The measurement problem remains one of the most persistent conceptual challenges in quantum mechanics [1,2]. The Copenhagen interpretation posits a discontinuous "collapse" of the wavefunction upon observation, introducing a dualism between unitary evolution and measurement [3]. Other interpretations — Bohmian mechanics [4], Many-Worlds [5] — preserve determinacy but introduce additional ontological structures.

The Logical Resolution Model (LRM) offers a simpler alternative:

1. The **Three Fundamental Laws of Logic** are *ontic* features of reality, constraining physical states at all times.
2. The **quantum state** is a description of our knowledge at a given resolution, not a direct representation of the system's ontic state [6].
3. **Collapse** is reinterpreted as the end-point of a continuous, physical resolution process.

## 2. Core Ontic Axiom

> **Core Ontic Axiom:** No manifestation of physical reality violates the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL).  
> **Formally:** For all physically real systems $S$, and for all well-defined properties $P$ of $S$:
> 1. **Identity:** $S$ is exactly one ontic state $s_{\text{ontic}}$ with respect to $P$.
> 2. **Non-Contradiction:** $S$ does not instantiate mutually exclusive states for $P$ simultaneously.
> 3. **Excluded Middle:** $S$ has exactly one admissible value of $P$ — never an in-between outside the admissible set.

**Interpretive consequence:** Quantum mechanics describes how our *resolution* of $s_{\text{ontic}}$ changes with interaction; it does not describe a reality that is ontically indefinite.

**Empirical Justification:** The claim that the 3FLL are ontic is grounded in observation: in the entire history of experimental physics, no measurement outcome has ever violated them. Every measurement yields: (1) exactly one state (Identity), (2) no contradictory properties (Non-Contradiction), and (3) one definite value from the admissible set (Excluded Middle) [7]. This exceptionless empirical validity parallels the justification for other fundamental principles, such as conservation laws [8] or Lorentz invariance [9]. Apparent "violations" in quantum superposition occur only in incomplete descriptions, never in actual measurement outcomes [10,11]. Thus, the burden of proof rests with critics to produce even one empirical counterexample where physical reality violates these logical laws.

## 3. Formal Structure of Predisposition and Resolution

*Notation:* $\mathcal{P}$ denotes the **predisposition set**, while $P(\cdot)$ denotes probability. The two are unrelated; the former is a subset of Hilbert space, the latter a numerical measure.

Let $\mathcal{H}$ be the system's Hilbert space.

- **Predisposition set:** A measurable subset $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathcal{H}$ fixed at preparation, determined by:
  - Field mode structure and emitter configuration [12]
  - Environmental constraints and conservation laws [13,14]
- **Topology:** Inherited from $\mathcal{H}$'s norm topology.
- **Measure:** Born measure restricted to $\mathcal{P}$ [15]:  
  $$\mu(A) = \langle \psi | \Pi_A | \psi \rangle, \quad A \subset \mathcal{P}$$
- **Symmetry:** $\mathcal{P} \mapsto U(g)\mathcal{P}$ for $g \in G$, where $G$ is the relevant symmetry group [16].

**Resolution** is a one-parameter semigroup of maps [17]:  
$$R_t : \mathcal{P} \to \mathcal{P}, \quad R_0 = \mathrm{id}, \quad \lim_{t \to T} R_t = \{ s_{\text{ontic}} \}$$

Physically, $t$ is interaction time; resolution progressively eliminates states in $\mathcal{P}$ inconsistent with observed interactions.

**Convergence:** In physical realizations, $R_t$ is generated by a completely positive, trace-preserving semigroup with a unique stationary state in the $\hat{O}$-diagonal subspace [18]. This uniqueness follows when the interaction Hamiltonian couples all off-diagonal sectors to $r$ with nonzero rate. Cyclic or multi-fixed-point behavior would require finely tuned degeneracies, which are unstable to generic apparatus or environmental perturbations [19].

## 4. Preparation via Quantum Fields

In QFT, particles are excitations of underlying fields [20,21]. **Emitters** — lasers [22], electron guns [23], spin filters [24] — manipulate the field to produce excitations constrained in momentum, spin, polarization, and other observables. These define $\mathcal{P}$. Physical boundaries arise from:

- Source geometry [25]
- Field mode structure [26]
- Environmental coupling [27]
- Conservation and symmetry restrictions [28]

## 5. Measurement as Resolution

### 5.1 Resolution Principle

A measurement is a physical interaction that increases the resolution of our description, eliminating members of $\mathcal{P}$ inconsistent with newly acquired information [29].

### 5.2 Maximum Resolution

**Operational definition:** Maximum resolution is reached when $\rho$ is diagonal in the $\hat{O}$-basis restricted to $\mathcal{P}$, and all off-diagonal elements fall below experimental detectability [30]. Physically, the coherence length is shorter than the smallest apparatus-resolvable feature.

Mathematically:  
$$\mathcal{P} \xrightarrow{\text{resolution}} \{ s_{\text{ontic}} \}, \quad P(o_i) = \|\Pi_{o_i} \psi\|^2$$

---

## 6. Symmetry, Decoherence, and Erasure

- **Symmetry breaking:** Resolution can break initial symmetries in $\mathcal{P}$ (e.g., double-slit with which-path info) [31].
- **Decoherence:** Environmental interactions act as uncontrolled resolution, breaking symmetries and suppressing interference [32,33].
- **Preferred basis:** In LRM, the preferred basis is fixed by the interaction Hamiltonian; decoherence naturally selects the same basis, with pointer states emerging from the interaction's structure [34,35].
- **Symmetry restoration:** Erasing distinguishing information expands $\mathcal{P}$ and restores interference [36].

## 7. Lagrangian Demonstration of Resolution Dynamics

We model resolution with a **resolution field** $r(t,\mathbf{x})$ coupled to the system field $\psi(t,\mathbf{x})$ in closed-time-path (CTP) form [37,38].

### 7.1 System Lagrangian
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{sys}} = i\hbar\,\psi^*\partial_t\psi - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}|\nabla\psi|^2 - V(\mathbf{x})\,|\psi|^2$$

### 7.2 Resolution Sector
Duplicate fields ($\psi_\pm$) for forward/backward time branches:  

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{res}} =$$

$$\frac{\chi}{2}(\partial_\mu r)(\partial^\mu r) - \frac{\mu^2}{2} r^2 + i\lambda\, r \big(\psi_+^* \hat{O} \psi_+ - \psi_-^* \hat{O} \psi_-\big)$$

Integrating out $r$ produces an influence functional that penalizes forward/backward disagreements in $\hat{O}$, generating dephasing in the $\hat{O}$-basis [39].

### 7.3 Master Equation
In the Born–Markov limit [40]:  
$$\partial_t \rho = -\frac{i}{\hbar}[H,\rho] - \gamma\,[\hat{O},[\hat{O},\rho]]$$

where $\gamma = \frac{\lambda^2}{2\hbar\,\mu^2}$ (bath factor).

Here $\gamma$ is the **resolution rate** — small $\gamma$ yields weak measurement; large $\gamma$ approaches maximum resolution. Continuous infinite $\gamma$ corresponds to the Zeno regime [41].

**Zeno Regime in LRM:** In LRM, the quantum Zeno effect corresponds to sustaining $\gamma$ at a very high value continuously, freezing the system in an eigenstate of $\hat{O}$. This is not interpreted as repeated "collapses" but as holding the resolution operator at maximum strength, preventing evolution into logically distinct alternatives.

**Interpretation:** The double commutator term eliminates contradictory eigenstate pairs from $\mathcal{P}$, aligning description with the ontic state.

### 7.4 Physical Interpretation of the Resolution Field

The resolution field $r(t,\mathbf{x})$ is an **effective degree of freedom** representing those physical channels that acquire, carry, or store distinguishing information about the system's state with respect to the chosen observable $\hat{O}$. In practice, $r$ can model:

- Apparatus degrees of freedom: pointer states, detector modes, readout electronics.
- Environmental modes: photons, phonons, spin baths that scatter from or couple to the system.
- Collective fields: effective coarse-grained fields summarizing many microscopic channels.

Integrating out $r$ corresponds to tracing over the degrees of freedom that mediate or record which-outcome information, producing the decohering influence functional. In experimental terms, $r$ is not a new physical field but a **bookkeeping proxy** for all modes that perform logical resolution through interaction.

## 8. Paradigmatic Examples

### 8.1 Double-Slit Interference under Logical Resolution

**Preparation:**  
An electron source emits particles with transverse wavefunction $\psi_{\text{in}}(y)$ incident on two slits at $y=\pm d/2$. The predisposition set $\mathcal{P}$ consists of the two path subspaces spanned by $\{\psi_L, \psi_R\}$.

**Without resolution:**  
$\mathcal{P}$ retains full path symmetry, so the outgoing state is  
$$\psi_{\text{out}} \propto \psi_L + \psi_R$$
Interference fringes appear on the screen.

**Resolution coupling:**  
Introduce a weak which-path detector modeled by $r(t)$ coupled to $\hat{O} = |L\rangle\langle L| - |R\rangle\langle R|$. The master equation  
$$\partial_t \rho = -\frac{i}{\hbar}[H,\rho] - \gamma[\hat{O},[\hat{O},\rho]]$$
suppresses the off-diagonal $\rho_{LR}$ at a rate $2\gamma$.

**Fringe visibility:**  
$$V(\gamma) = V_0 e^{-2\gamma T}$$
where $T$ is the transit time between slits and screen.  
- $\gamma \to 0$: full interference (low resolution)  
- $\gamma \gg 1/T$: no interference (max resolution)  
- Intermediate $\gamma$: partial visibility (weak measurement regime)

**Interpretation:**  
Resolution acts by eliminating the contradictory pair $\{\psi_L,\psi_R\}$ from the admissible description, leaving only one path component in the high-resolution limit.

### 8.2 Bell/EPR
Joint predisposition set $\mathcal{P}_{AB} \subset \mathcal{H}_A \otimes \mathcal{H}_B$ evolves under correlated resolution operators, reproducing CHSH violations.

### 8.3 GHZ States
LRM resolution on multi-qubit systems respects nonlocal correlations without additional hidden variables.

## 9. Born Rule

Two options:
1. **Postulate:** The Born measure governs resolution probabilities.
2. **Derivation:** Use Gleason's theorem restricted to $\mathcal{P}$, preserving standard QM probabilities.

## 10. Comparison with Other Interpretations

| Interpretation | Ontic State | Collapse | Ontic Logic | Extra Ontology |
|----------------|-------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Copenhagen | Indefinite pre-measurement | Postulate | No | None |
| Bohmian | Definite at all times | Epistemic | Implicit | Pilot wave |
| Many-Worlds | All outcomes realized | Branching | No | Infinite worlds |
| QBism | Epistemic only | Bayesian update | No | None |
| **LRM** | Definite at all times | Resolution endpoint | **Yes** | None |

## 11. Empirical Equivalence and Predictions

- Reproduces all interference phenomena (double-slit, delayed choice, quantum eraser).
- Matches Bell test outcomes without local hidden variables.

**Potential Experimental Distinction:**  
If there are physical limits on $\gamma$ set by the maximum coupling between system and resolution channels, then LRM predicts a **finite minimum coherence length** in any basis, even under strong measurement attempts. An experiment could test this by attempting to increase measurement strength (e.g., cavity-QED photon detection rate) beyond the putative $\gamma_{\max}$ and observing whether residual interference remains. Standard QM with ideal projective measurement predicts complete visibility loss; LRM with finite $\gamma_{\max}$ predicts a nonzero floor.

---

## 12. Conclusion

The Logical Resolution Model integrates the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic directly into the ontology of physics. Quantum measurement is a continuous refinement of our description of a fixed ontic state, not an ontic collapse. Preparation defines a bounded predisposition set; resolution — through interaction — reduces it to the actual state. The Lagrangian construction shows that resolution emerges from physical couplings within standard field theory. LRM preserves empirical adequacy, reduces conceptual complexity, and removes observer dependence.
